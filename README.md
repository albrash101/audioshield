🎧 AudioShield — Real-Time Transcription with Encryption
AudioShield is a lightweight browser extension that transcribes spoken audio in real time using the Web Speech API, then encrypts and stores the transcript securely using the JavaScript Crypto API. Designed for privacy-conscious users, it ensures that sensitive spoken content is protected from unauthorized access.

🚀 Features
• 	🎙️ Live Speech Recognition
Transcribes spoken words instantly using browser-native speech recognition.
• 	🔐 AES-GCM Encryption
Every transcript is encrypted before storage using secure cryptographic methods.
• 	📄 Continuous Line Transcription
Displays speech in a flowing paragraph format, with automatic breaks after long pauses.
• 	🕒 Pause Detection
Automatically inserts paragraph breaks after 3 seconds of silence.
• 	🧠 No Frameworks Required
Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no React, no Tailwind.
🧩 Decryptor Module
The Decryptor folder contains a standalone tool that allows users to decrypt previously encrypted transcripts using the same AES-GCM encryption scheme. This module ensures that only authorized users with the correct key can access the original speech content.
🔓 Features
• 	Secure Decryption
Uses AES-GCM to decrypt stored transcripts with a user-provided key.
• 	Simple Interface
Clean HTML/JS interface for pasting encrypted data and viewing decrypted output.
• 	Offline Capable
No server calls — all decryption happens locally in the browser.
